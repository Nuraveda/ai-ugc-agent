> **Part of the [Mesh Pilot](https://meshpilot.app) open-source 6-agent marketing stack.**
> Short-form vertical (9:16) AI UGC video ad pipeline — built for cost-per-acquisition, not organic views.

Takes a structured brief (`product`, `audience`, `hook_angles`) and produces a finished MP4 with a synthesized actor, voiced script, b-roll, BGM, and TikTok-style captions. Designed to plug into the ads agent's approval flow — every variant queues for human review before it spends a dollar.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/nuraveda-lab/ai-ugc-agent.git
# or: git clone https://codeberg.org/Nuraveda_lab/ai-ugc-agent.git
cd ai-ugc-agent

uv pip install -e .          # or: pip install -e .
pnpm install                 # only if you want the Remotion fallback path
cp .env.example .env         # HeyGen / Pexels / ElevenLabs / etc. keys

cp src/ugc/briefs/example.yaml briefs/my_product.yaml
# edit briefs/my_product.yaml with your product, audience, hook angles
ugc render briefs/my_product.yaml
```

## What it does

1. **Brief** — you write a short YAML describing the product, audience pain, and the hook angles you want to A/B test.
2. **Scripts** — the agent expands each hook into a full 15–30s ad body around a single CTA.
3. **Render** — pluggable rendering pipeline:
   - HeyGen Video Agent CLI (recommended primary path)
   - Pexels + Remotion + ElevenLabs + ffmpeg (manual fallback)
   - fal.ai / Higgsfield / Omnihuman (experimental variants in `scripts/`)
4. **Output** — vertical 9:16 MP4 with captions ready for Meta / TikTok ads.

## The HITL pattern (shared across the stack)

Generated variants don't auto-publish. They're produced as draft assets that the [ads agent](https://gitlab.com/nuraveda-lab/ai-ads-agent) (or any downstream uploader) queues through its approval gate. In the [Mesh Pilot](https://meshpilot.app) cockpit, those drafts show up in the same web inbox where every cross-agent proposal lands.

## Why open source

This repo started as one of six agents in a closed digital-marketing stack. The engine is general-purpose; brand-specific prompt tuning, operational guardrails, and proprietary fine-tuning that turn it into a deployable product live elsewhere. What's open here is **the pipeline** — brief format, render adapters, caption tooling, BGM mixing, plus the v6→v18 iteration history showing what worked and what didn't.

## Layout

```
src/ugc/        # core Python package — pipeline + brief loader
scripts/        # render iterations (v6 → v18) showing the path
                # from naive ffmpeg to HeyGen Video Agent
remotion/       # Remotion-based caption + b-roll composer (the fallback)
tests/          # smoke tests + caption / variant unit tests
assets/bgm/     # background music clips (only royalty-free clips ship)
pyproject.toml  # Python deps (uv / pip install -e .)
package.json    # Remotion / Node deps (pnpm install)
```
